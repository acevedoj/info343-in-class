/* FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
Functional programming is a style of programming
based not on objects and methods, but on small,
generic, and reusable "pure" functions. A pure
function has these properties:
- they operate only on their inputs, and make no 
    reference to other data (e.g., variables at a 
    higher scope)
- they never modify their inputsâ€”instead, they 
    always return new data or a reference to
    unmodified inputs
- they have no side effects outside of their outputs 
    (e.g., they never modify variables at a higher scope)
- because of these previous rules, they always return 
    the same outputs for the same inputs

Functional programming is possible in languages
like JavaScript that treat functions as values.
We can pass functions to other functions as
parameters, and even return functions from other
functions as the function's return value.
*/

/* THE DATA
The babynames_2016.js file defines one global
variable named BABYNAMES, which is set to an
array containing 32,868 objects. Each object
is a record reporting how many babies were
registered with the Social Security Administration
in 2016 with a particular name and biological sex.

Each object has the same 3 properties:
 - name: a first name
 - sex: the biological sex reported to the SSA
 - count: the number of babies registered with
          the SSA with that name and sex.

only those elements for which the predicate function
